Enjoy2
======

Enjoy2 is a simple program for Mac OSX that allows you to transform joystick inputs into keyboard or mouse events.

If you've ever played a video game which only supports mouse and keyboard input, but you want to use a joystick or gamepad, then Enjoy2 is the program for you. Enjoy2 lets you map your joystick inputs to:

* Key events
* Mouse clicks
* Mouse movement (for analog sticks)
* Scrolling

Enjoy2 supports multiple configurations (for different games or programs) and you can even map joystick buttons to change configurations on-the-fly.

Enjoy2 is written by [Yifeng Huang](htty://nongraphical.com) and is based on [Enjoy by Sam McCall](http://abstractable.net/enjoy/). Enjoy2 is MIT-licensed.

## How to use

At startup, and when Enjoy2 is paused, press any button or move any analog stick to jump to the configuration for that button or stick. From there, select one of the mapping options from the choices on the right.

To use an analog axis to move the mouse, select the "Analog" sub-item on the left.

### Mapping modes

Enjoy2 offers two mouse mapping modes: global and single-window. Enjoy2 starts in global mode, but you can set any joystick button to the "toggle mouse scope" action, which will change the mode. If you are using Enjoy2 to play a video game, you may find that one or the other mode offers better compatibility with your game's specific requirements.
